# Longsight Light Theme

A colorful, yet eye-friendly, theme designed for use on data projectors, where dark themes do not suit well. Pretty usable on regular screens as well.

> Supported syntaxes: Markdown, PHP, HTML, [S]CSS and (Java | Type)script.

In **Microsoft Visual Studio Code** (download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)), press `Ctrl + P`. Paste `ext install fgcintra.longsight-light-theme` into the box and hit `Enter`. Reload VSCode window when done.
